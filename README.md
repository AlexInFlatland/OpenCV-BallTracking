# Tracking a ball and rotating camera with OpenCV and Arduino
OpenCV tracks a ball, and the Arduino controls a servo motor to rotate the camera in case the ball goes off-screen. That way you get a tracking range of well over 180 degrees.
A video of the project in motion can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6j02lN5gDw
Look for the OpenCV (C++) code and the Arduino code in the repository.
